00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What are Inline Functions?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,844
In this video,

3
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:10,961
we will get an understanding of what is meant by Inline Functions and how it can be applied in Computational Thinking.

4
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:19,404
Inline functions are additional functions which can be input into the Main functions to calculate or convert values within the line of code.

5
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:23,927
Some common inline functions you will be using often would be Inline Lists,

6
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:24,530
Constants,

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,918
Random and Conversions.

8
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:25,918


9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,280
Inline - List

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,074
 Len(list)  returns the number of items in the list,

11
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,807
also known as the length of the list.

12
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:39,257
Let's say that  List1 = [0,

13
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:39,351
1,

14
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:39,445
2,

15
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:39,866
3] .

16
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:44,223
 Length_of_List1 = len(List1) .

17
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:45,066
When the variable,

18
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:48,111
 Length_of_List1  is printed,

19
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:50,079
the value 4 will be printed as the output.

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,234
This is because there are 4 items in the list.

21
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:52,468
Thus,

22
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:54,951
the length of  List1  is 4.

23
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:54,951


24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,100
 Range(start,

25
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,474
end)  generates a list of integers from start to  n - 1  given that end  =  n.

26
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:03,301
Following the example,

27
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,593
 List2 = Range(0,

28
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:09,689
5)  will generate a list containing the values from  0  to  4   

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,921
 Range(start,

30
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:12,102
end,

31
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:18,618
step)  generates a list of integers from start to  n - 1  given that end  =  n,

32
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:19,839
with a specified step size.

33
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:20,835
Following the example,

34
00:01:20,835 --> 00:01:23,866
 List2 = Range(0,

35
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:23,957
5,

36
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:26,400
2)  will generate a list containing the values 0,

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,762
2 and 4.

38
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:26,762


39
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,880
 isList(List)  returns True if the specified variable is a list and false if it is not.

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,492
For example,

41
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:36,449
 List4 = [ ] .

42
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:36,704
Thus,

43
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:40,120
when  isList(List4)  is printed,

44
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,344
the output will be True.

45
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:41,344


46
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,650
Inline - Constants

47
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,397
There are inline constants as well.

48
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:58,880
An example would be    which is written as  PI  in the Mobius Modeller.Another example would be  XY  which define a plane at the origin aligned on the  XY  Â axis.

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:58,930
 

50
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:05,059
Another example would be  XY  which define a plane at the origin aligned on the  XY  Â axis.

51
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:05,104
 

52
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,150
Inline - Random

53
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,773
Inlines can be used to generate random numbers.

54
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:12,838
 Rand(min,

55
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:16,243
max)  will return a random number in the specific range.

56
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:16,913
For example,

57
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:20,709
if  my_number = Rand(0,

58
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:21,211
2) ,

59
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:24,784
then the computer will generate a random number between 0 and 2,

60
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:28,412
inclusive of the minimum number but excluding the maximum number.

61
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:30,477
The numbers include decimals as well.

62
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:30,477


63
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,582
 RandInt(min,

64
00:02:33,582 --> 00:02:36,945
max)  will return a random Integer in the specific range.

65
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:37,595
For example,

66
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:41,879
if  my_number = RandInt(0,

67
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,367
2) ,

68
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:45,892
then the computer will generate a random integer between 0 and 2,

69
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:49,417
inclusive of the minimum number but excluding the maximum number.

70
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:49,688
Thus,

71
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:53,321
the value 0 or 1 will be generated every time the code is executed.

72
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:53,321


73
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,868
 Rand(min,

74
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:56,064
max,

75
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:59,103
seed)  will return a random number in the specific range,

76
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:02,044
but the same random number upon every execution of the code.

77
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:02,093
 

78
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,290
Inline - Conversion

79
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,862
Inlines can also be used to convert values.

80
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:11,273
This is because some functions only accept radian values,

81
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:15,820
but it is more intuitive to use  degrees .

82
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:15,820


83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,258
This sums up the video on Inline functions.

84
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:23,351
Next up are some practice questions for your revision.

85
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,942
See you next session.

86
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:24,942


87
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,170
The End
